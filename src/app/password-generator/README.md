### What I learned

This project was really interesting. I learned about styling checkboxes and
input-range across different browsers. It also helped me improve my coding
skills, especially when developing the algorithm to generate passwords and check
their strength.

### Useful resources

- [Input range generator](https://range-input-css.netlify.app/)
